## Directions

You'll need Python 2.7 and the [App Engine SDK](https://developers.google.com/appengine/downloads).

Run this command to build PyCrypto. It's built locally so it won't pollute your global site-packages. Using Brew is fine too.

    cd pycrypto
    python setup.py build

You need some secret keys for the session cookie library and XSRF protection. Run this script once to generate them.

    ./make_secrets.sh

#### To run the app locally

    ./run_server.sh
    # Navigate to http://localhost:8080

####  To see frontend tests

    ./run_server.sh
    # Navigate to http://localhost:8080/tests/index.html

#### To compile the JS into a binary

    ./gendepsfile.sh
    ./compile.sh
    # Notice that deps.js and compiled.js have changed
