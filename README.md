# Directions

#### To run the app locally, be sure to use these flags for dev_appserver:

    --require_indexes --high_replication

  Along with Python 2.7


####  To get a new install working on your machine:

NOTE: If you are using Mac OS X 10.7, you should use "brew install python" to
build an alternative version of Python that has much more sane site packages.
Learn about brew here (http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/). Be sure to update
the Launcher application to point at /usr/local/bin/python2.7.

You'll need setuptools installed in your environment.

The following commands don't use sudo because "brew" doesn't require it.

    svn checkout http://8-bits.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ 8-bits  
    cd 8-bits  
    cd pycrypto-2.3  
    python2.7 setup.py install  
    cd ../  
    cd nose-1*  
    python2.7 setup.py install  
    cd ../  
    cd nose-gae  
    python2.7 setup.py install  
    cd ../  


####  To run the backend tests:

    cd backend  
    ./run_tests.sh

####  To run frontend tests:

    cd backend  
    dev_appserver.py -a 0.0.0.0 .
    # Navigate to http://localhost:8080/tests/index.html

#### To compile the Closure JS into a binary:

    cd frontend
    ./gendepsfile.sh
    ./compile.sh
