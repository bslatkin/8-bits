* To run the app locally, be sure to use these flags for dev_appserver:

  --require_indexes --high_replication

  Along with Python2.7


* To get a new install working on your machine:

  NOTE: If you are using Mac OS X 10.7, you should use "brew install python" to
  build an alternative version of Python that has much more sane site packages.
  Learn about brew here (http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/). Be sure to update
  the Launcher application to point at /usr/local/bin/python2.7.

  You'll need setuptools installed in your environment.

  The following commands don't use sudo because "brew" doesn't require it.

svn checkout http://8-bits.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ 8-bits
cd 8-bits
cd pycrypto-2.3
python2.7 setup.py install
cd ../
cd nose-1*
python2.7 setup.py install
cd ../
cd nose-gae
python2.7 setup.py install
cd ../


* To run the backend tests:

cd backend
./run_tests.sh


* To run frontend tests:

cd backend
dev_appserver.py -a 0.0.0.0 .
# Navigate to http://localhost:8080/tests/index.html


* To compile the Closure JS into a binary:

cd frontend/js/bits
./compile.sh


* To update SVN externals (including github projects):

svn propset svn:externals . -F svn_externals.txt
