v2 features:
- Pasting URLs starts a new topic
- Topic menu with auto-threading of chat
- Read state on topics and non-topic chat
- Reload client window on new version push

v2 polish:
- Move favicons into data URIs; otherwise they hit the cache
- When notifying, double check if we're the top window and cancel if so
- Clean up code comments and style everywhere
- Pass through error traceback to users

Bugs:
- Make splitpane collapse down to show all chat, not up
- after resizing a window smaller, when the chat scrolly was all the way at the bottom, the scrolly won't be at the bottom anymore and you have to rescroll it all the way down

v2 production:
- http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_Strict_Transport_Security
